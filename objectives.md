Objectives

Train deep net on mnist dataset
Use results to find digits which are misclassified or junk
Manually look through all remaining to find any which are junk or misclassified

Try to prove there is no such thing as overtraining if you reduce the number of input parameters to the model

Try to generate synthetic data. For example, for each number what is the "most" number?

Meaning: For number 1, what is the most 1 looking output according to the neural net?
What combination of inputs produces that output?
